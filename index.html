                        It cannot be denied that employment is important when it comes to discussing a country's economic standing as
                        employment dictates a societal and also the country's development. Hence, as we discuss the state of employment trends
                        in Malaysia during the 2000's and 2010's we are able to see how this Southeast Asian nation with it's diverse economy 
                        evolve over time as different sectors deal with different challenges. Within this window of time marks substantial growth
                        as Malaysia is home to many industries dealing with export and as infrastructure development progresses deal to the evergrowing 
                        population, there exist a demand for manpower leading to job opportunities which will be discussed.

                        In this visualization, we examine the relationship between unemployment rates and Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in a regional context. 
                        While it's natural to assume that rising unemployment rates might be accompanied by a significant decline in GDP, the data tells a different 
                        story. As we observe the choropleth map illustrating unemployment rates, we can discern regions with varying rates of unemployment. However, 
                        juxtaposed with the map depicting GDP, it becomes evident that these fluctuations in unemployment rates do not consistently correspond to 
                        changes in economic output. This intriguing finding challenges conventional economic expectations and highlights the complex and multifaceted 
                        nature of regional economic dynamics. In essence, the data reveals that, in some instances, higher unemployment rates are not synonymous with 
                        a proportional decrease in GDP, demonstrating the need for a nuanced understanding of the intricate factors that influence regional economies.
